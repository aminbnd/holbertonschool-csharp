# 0x0D. C# - Text-based Interface
## For this project:
* Based on the requirements of each task, you should write the documentation and tests first before you actually code anything
* The intranet checks for C# projects won’t be released before their first deadline in order for you to focus more on TDD and thinking about all possible cases
* We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you don’t miss any edge cases
* <b>Don’t trust the user</b>, always think about all possible edge cases
